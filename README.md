# Spaceship_Game
This is a Spaceship game made for a college evaluation.
The music was not requested in the evaluation I just added it as a bonus to make the game fun to play.

## Libraries
You need Slick2D to run this project.
Also, change the -Djava.library.path to your Slick2D library path.

## How to play
When you press play, you can use the arrow keys or WASD to move around and press SPACEBAR to shoot.
You have to collect the most amount of asteroids. To be able to collect an asteroid, it has to be smaller than the spaceship otherwise it will take a life from you.
If you lose all of your lives, you die and you can restart or leave the game.
